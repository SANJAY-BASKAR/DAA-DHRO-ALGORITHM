# 📝 Dhro Algorithm - Smart Exam Scheduling

## 📌 Introduction  
The **Dhro Algorithm (Dynamic Heuristic Resource Optimization)** is an intelligent scheduling algorithm designed for **large-scale examination systems**. It efficiently assigns **time slots and rooms** while minimizing conflicts, ensuring fairness, and optimizing resource utilization.  

## 🚀 Features  
✅ **Graph-Based Conflict Detection** – Constructs a conflict graph for exams based on student enrollment.  
✅ **Greedy Scheduling** – Uses a graph-coloring approach to allocate non-overlapping time slots.  
✅ **Fairness Optimization** – Ensures students do not have back-to-back exams.  
✅ **Efficient Room Assignment** – Dynamically assigns rooms based on subject demand.  
✅ **Scalable & Adaptive** – Works well for small and large institutions.
