# 📝 Dhro Algorithm - Smart Exam Scheduling

## 📌 Introduction  
The **Dhro Algorithm (Dynamic Heuristic Resource Optimization)** is an intelligent scheduling algorithm designed for **large-scale examination systems**. It efficiently assigns **time slots and rooms** while minimizing conflicts, ensuring fairness, and optimizing resource utilization.  

---

## 🚀 Features  
✔ **Graph-Based Conflict Detection** – Constructs a conflict graph based on student enrollments.  
✔ **Greedy Scheduling** – Uses a graph-coloring approach to allocate non-overlapping time slots.  
✔ **Fairness Optimization** – Ensures students do not have back-to-back exams.  
✔ **Efficient Room Assignment** – Dynamically assigns rooms based on subject demand.  
✔ **Scalable & Adaptive** – Works well for both small and large institutions.

## ⚙️ Installation  
To run the Dhro Algorithm, install the required dependencies:  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## ▶️ Usage  
Run the algorithm using:  
```bash
python dhro_algorithm.py
```
You can modify the exam data inside **`dhro_algorithm.py`** or provide an external **JSON file** for input.

## 📈 Algorithm Workflow  
1️⃣ **Construct Conflict Graph** – Identify exams with overlapping students.  
2️⃣ **Graph Coloring for Scheduling** – Assign time slots using a greedy algorithm.  
3️⃣ **Fairness Adjustment** – Prevents students from having consecutive exams.  
4️⃣ **Room Assignment** – Dynamically allocates rooms based on subject demand.  

---

## 💻 Example Code  
```python
import numpy as np
import networkx as nx

# Step 1: Load exam data
exams = {
    'Math': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'],
    'Physics': ['Bob', 'Charlie', 'David'],
    'Chemistry': ['Alice', 'David', 'Eve'],
    'Biology': ['Charlie', 'Eve', 'Frank'],
    'English': ['Alice', 'Frank', 'Grace']
}

# Step 2: Construct Conflict Graph
conflict_graph = nx.Graph()
for subject, students in exams.items():
    conflict_graph.add_node(subject)
    for other_subject, other_students in exams.items():
        if subject != other_subject and set(students) & set(other_students):
            conflict_graph.add_edge(subject, other_subject)

# Step 3: Graph Coloring for Scheduling
def greedy_coloring(graph):
    coloring = {}
    for node in sorted(graph, key=lambda x: len(graph[x]), reverse=True):
        available_colors = set(range(len(graph)))
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            if neighbor in coloring:
                available_colors.discard(coloring[neighbor])
        coloring[node] = min(available_colors)
    return coloring

time_slots = greedy_coloring(conflict_graph)

# Step 4: Print Final Exam Schedule
print("Final Exam Schedule:")
for subject, slot in time_slots.items():
    print(f"{subject} - Time Slot {slot}")
```

---

## 💡 Example Output  
```
Final Exam Schedule:
Math - Time Slot 0
Physics - Time Slot 1
Chemistry - Time Slot 2
Biology - Time Slot 3
English - Time Slot 4
```

## 📊 Complexity Analysis  

| Case        | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
|------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Best Case  | **O(N log N)**  | **O(N)** |
| Average Case | **O(N²)**  | **O(N)** |
| Worst Case  | **O(N²)**  | **O(N)** |

Where **N** is the number of exams.
